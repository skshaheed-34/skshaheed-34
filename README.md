🚀 About Me

I’m a Computer Engineering graduate student with hands-on experience across ASIC/SoC design, RTL development, and design verification. My work focuses on building reliable and efficient hardware systems through SystemVerilog/UVM-based verification, RTL implementation, FPGA prototyping, and automation-driven validation.

I enjoy working across the design–verification boundary, debugging complex functional and timing issues using waveform analysis, coverage feedback, and structured validation workflows.

I’m currently seeking Full-Time opportunities in:
