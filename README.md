🚀 About Me
I’m a Computer Engineering graduate student with hands-on experience across ASIC/SoC design, RTL development, and design verification. My work focuses on building reliable and efficient hardware systems through SystemVerilog/UVM-based verification, RTL implementation, FPGA prototyping, and automation-driven validation.
I enjoy working across the design–verification boundary, debugging complex functional and timing issues using waveform analysis, coverage feedback, and structured validation workflows.
I’m currently seeking Full-Time opportunities in:
•	ASIC / RTL Design
•	SoC / Design Verification
•	FPGA & Hardware Validation
